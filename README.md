# SimplifiedMonopoly
Simplified Monopoly using MVC Design Pattern where it helps in making a concrete Monopoly game with organised and understandable code 
with the Controller(Board) created as a Singleton in order make sure that only one Instance of a Board represents the game.
It divides the solution into three components: the model that 
manage the data and their rules, the view that display the components and the controller that control the
two previous components. It focuses on the use cases of the service,
requirements and its architecture.
